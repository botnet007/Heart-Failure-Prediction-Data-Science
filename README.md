# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Data-Science
 The project preprocesses heart health data, encodes features, and visualizes distributions. It trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for heart disease prediction, achieving [insert accuracy here]%. Finally, the model is saved as 'my_model.pkl' for future deployment and analysis.
